Team,

Major progress on the Dubai Police SWAT project since our last update. We've made significant technical corrections and have a clearer path forward. Here's what you need to know:

## üéØ KEY DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration Finalized
We've locked down the final system configuration after extensive technical review:
- **Audio:** INVISIO V60 II + X7 headset (confirmed compact size: 70√ó63√ó25mm, not the oversized estimate)
- **Device:** Samsung S25 **forearm-mounted** (not hand or chest) with Bunker MAAK case
- **Power:** Revised to dual 21,000mAh hot-swap system for 8-hour operation (not 15)
- **Cables:** Only 4 cables total (we had 7 in original design - removed fictional connections)

### Critical Technical Corrections
1. **Samsung Position:** Forearm with 3 velcro straps (we had it wrong as hand-mount)
2. **Power Requirements:** Recalculated for 8 hours = 33,600mAh needed (42,000mAh provides 25% reserve)
3. **Cable Count:** Only 4 actual cables (Tetra-INVISIO, Samsung-INVISIO, 2√ó USB-C power)
4. **INVISIO Power:** V60 II draws power from devices - no internal battery needed

### Documentation Issues Resolved
- ‚ùå **Problem:** Powkey power banks have NO official PDF datasheets
- ‚úÖ **Solution:** Documented alternatives (STAR-PAN, Bittium, dual Anker setup)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive specifications from available sources

## üìä REVISED PRICING

**Updated Cost per Kit:** AED 38,500 (down from AED 51,380)
- Smaller battery system saves AED 3,000/kit
- Simplified cable configuration saves AED 1,500/kit
- More accurate component pricing

**Volume Pricing:**
- 6 kits: AED 231,000
- 8 kits: AED 300,000 (2.6% discount)
- 10 kits: AED 365,000 (5.2% discount)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### 1. Power System Validation
**Issue:** Powkey lacks proper documentation  
**Risk:** Can't verify specifications  
**Action Needed:** Engineering to evaluate alternatives:
- Option A: STAR-PAN military system (Glenair)
- Option B: Dual Anker 40K setup (consumer but reliable)
- Option C: Custom LiFePO4 assembly

**Decision Required by:** Friday, Feb 2

### 2. Samsung S25 Availability
**Issue:** Device not yet released in UAE  
**Risk:** Delivery timeline uncertainty  
**Action Needed:** Procurement to:
- Contact MDS Mobile (Premium Samsung Reseller)
- Get pre-order confirmation
- Explore S24 as backup option

**Decision Required by:** Thursday, Feb 1

### 3. Cable Fabrication
**Issue:** Custom Tetra 26-pin to INVISIO cable needed  
**Risk:** 6-8 week lead time for MIL-SPEC  
**Action Needed:** Engineering to:
- Confirm exact Tetra connector model
- Get quotes from Glenair/Amphenol
- Consider off-the-shelf alternatives

**Decision Required by:** Friday, Feb 2

## üö® RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Power documentation | HIGH | Multiple supplier options | Engineering |
| S25 availability | MEDIUM | S24 backup plan ready | Procurement |
| Heat performance | HIGH | Over-spec components by 20% | Engineering |
| Cable lead time | MEDIUM | Start fabrication immediately | Procurement |

## üí° OPPORTUNITIES

1. **INVISIO has Abu Dhabi office** - Direct local support possible
2. **MDS Mobile relationship** - Potential for better Samsung pricing
3. **Simplified design** - Easier training and maintenance
4. **Hot-swap feature** - Major differentiator vs competition

## üìÖ CRITICAL DATES

- **Jan 31 (Wed):** Internal design review - 2PM
- **Feb 1 (Thu):** Samsung availability confirmation needed
- **Feb 2 (Fri):** Customer proposal submission deadline
- **Feb 5 (Mon):** Expected customer feedback
- **Feb 7 (Wed):** Target contract signature

## üéØ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

‚úÖ Power solution validated and documented  
‚úÖ Samsung S25 pre-orders confirmed  
‚úÖ Cable specifications approved  
‚úÖ Customer accepts AED 38,500 price point  
‚úÖ 6-8 week delivery commitment secured  

## üìû QUESTIONS?

Let's discuss in tomorrow's standup. Key decisions needed:
1. Power system - which option?
2. Samsung backup plan - S24 acceptable?
3. Cable sourcing - custom or modified COTS?

Please review attached documents before our Wednesday design review.

Thanks for the continued effort on this high-visibility project. Customer is eager to move forward - let's deliver!
