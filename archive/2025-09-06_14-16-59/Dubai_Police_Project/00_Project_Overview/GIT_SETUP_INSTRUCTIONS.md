# Git Repository Setup Instructions
**Version: v1.0**

## Manual Git Initialization Steps

Since automated git commands cannot be executed through the file management tools, you'll need to run these commands manually in your terminal.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have git installed on your system
- Navigate to the project directory: `/Users/user/Desktop/Dubai police dismounted soldier/`

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd "/Users/user/Desktop/Dubai police dismounted soldier/"
git init
```

### Step 2: Configure Git (if not already done globally)
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Step 3: Review .gitignore
The `.gitignore` file has been created to exclude:
- Log files
- System files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- PDF files (marked as confidential)
- Temporary and backup files
- Sensitive information patterns

### Step 4: Add Files to Staging
```bash
# Add only markdown files and .gitignore
git add *.md
git add .gitignore

# Or add all files (will respect .gitignore)
git add .
```

### Step 5: Create Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Dubai Police SWAT Kit documentation v1.0

- Added Bill of Quantities (BOQ) with two configuration options
- Added Technical Specifications Comparison
- Added System Integration Diagrams
- Added Email draft to technical team
- Added ROM Pricing Estimates
- All documents versioned as v1.0"
```

### Step 6: Optional - Set up Remote Repository
If you want to push to a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):
```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **WARNING**: These documents contain CONFIDENTIAL information:
- Dubai Police procurement details
- Sensitive pricing information
- Technical specifications for security equipment

### Recommendations:
1. **Use a private repository** if pushing to remote
2. **Consider using Git LFS** for any large files
3. **Never push to public repositories**
4. **Regularly review access permissions**
5. **Consider using Git Crypt or similar** for additional encryption

## File Status After Setup

### Versioned Files (v1.0):
- `Dubai_Police_SWAT_Kit_BOQ.md`
- `Technical_Specifications_Comparison.md`  
- `Integration_Diagrams.md`
- `Email_to_Technical_Team.md`
- `ROM_Pricing_Estimate.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `GIT_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Ignored Files:
- All PDF files (confidential vendor datasheets)
- Log files in `logs/` directory
- System files
- The `--db-path` file

## Next Steps

1. Execute the git commands above manually
2. Verify the repository was created: `git status`
3. Check that only appropriate files are tracked: `git ls-files`
4. Consider setting up branch protection rules if using remote repository
5. Plan for regular commits as documentation evolves

## Troubleshooting

### Directory Name Issues
The directory name contains spaces which can cause shell issues:
- Always use quotes when referencing the path
- Consider renaming to `dubai-police-swat-kit` for easier handling

### Large File Warnings
If git complains about large files:
- Check if PDF files are being tracked despite .gitignore
- Use `git rm --cached <filename>` to untrack accidentally added files
- Consider using Git LFS for legitimate large files
