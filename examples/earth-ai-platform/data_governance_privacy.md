# Data Governance & Privacy

### Comprehensive Data Governance Framework

BEACON RED's AI Data Platform implements enterprise-grade data governance ensuring complete data lifecycle management from ingestion to archival. Our framework provides automated data classification using machine learning algorithms to identify sensitive information, assign appropriate security levels, and enforce retention policies based on regulatory requirements and business rules.

### Regulatory Compliance & Privacy Protection

The platform achieves full GDPR and CCPA compliance through built-in privacy controls including automated consent management, data subject request handling, and right-to-be-forgotten capabilities. Our privacy-by-design architecture implements data minimization principles, purpose limitation, and automated anonymization techniques to protect individual privacy while maximizing analytical value.

Compliance monitoring includes real-time audit trails, automated violation detection, and comprehensive reporting dashboards for regulatory oversight. The system maintains detailed data lineage tracking, enabling complete traceability of data transformations and ensuring auditability for compliance officers.

### Data Quality & Lineage Management

Automated data quality controls validate incoming data against predefined schemas, business rules, and statistical models. The platform implements continuous monitoring with configurable alerts for data anomalies, completeness issues, and quality degradation patterns.

Comprehensive lineage tracking captures end-to-end data flow from source systems through transformation pipelines to analytical outputs. Interactive lineage visualization tools enable data stewards to understand data provenance, impact analysis, and dependency mapping for change management.

### Access Controls & Security Framework

Role-based access control (RBAC) with attribute-based refinements ensures least-privilege access to sensitive data assets. The platform implements zero-trust security principles with continuous authentication, dynamic authorization, and session monitoring.

Data encryption at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.3 standards protects information confidentiality. Advanced anonymization techniques including k-anonymity, differential privacy, and synthetic data generation enable safe analytics on sensitive datasets.
