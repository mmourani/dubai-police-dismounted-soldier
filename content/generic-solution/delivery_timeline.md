# Delivery Timeline & Milestones

## Project Timeline

Implementation follows a phased approach spanning 16 weeks from contract award through final acceptance. The timeline incorporates risk mitigation buffers and client approval gates to ensure quality delivery while maintaining schedule flexibility for unforeseen circumstances.

## Key Milestones

**Phase 1 - Project Initiation (Weeks 1-2)**
Contract finalization, project kickoff meetings, and detailed requirements validation. Client stakeholder identification and communication protocols establishment.

**Phase 2 - Procurement & Preparation (Weeks 3-8)**
Equipment procurement, factory acceptance testing, and site preparation coordination. Technical documentation review and integration planning activities.

**Phase 3 - Delivery & Installation (Weeks 9-12)**
Equipment delivery, site installation, and initial system configuration. Network integration and security implementation with basic functionality validation.

**Phase 4 - Testing & Commissioning (Weeks 13-15)**
Comprehensive system testing, performance validation, and security verification. User training delivery and operational procedure development.

**Phase 5 - Acceptance & Handover (Week 16)**
Final acceptance testing, documentation handover, and warranty activation. Operational readiness confirmation and project closure activities.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

Critical path dependencies include timely client approvals, site access availability, and existing infrastructure readiness. Equipment procurement lead times assume standard configurations without extensive customization requirements.

Client resource availability for training sessions and acceptance procedures represents key scheduling constraints. Weather conditions may affect installation timelines for outdoor equipment components, requiring seasonal planning considerations.

Payment milestone alignment supports project cash flow while providing client protection through performance-based payment releases. Change control procedures accommodate scope modifications while protecting baseline schedule commitments.
