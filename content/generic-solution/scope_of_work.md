# Scope of Work & Supply

## Equipment Supply

This engagement includes the design, procurement, and delivery of a complete integrated solution comprising core processing systems, user interface components, and supporting infrastructure. The supply scope encompasses primary hardware platforms, software licensing, security appliances, and all necessary connectivity components configured for immediate deployment.

All equipment is delivered factory-configured according to agreed specifications, including pre-installed software, security certificates, and baseline configuration profiles. Supply includes spare components for critical systems ensuring operational continuity during the initial deployment period.

## Installation & Integration

Professional installation services include site survey, equipment positioning, network configuration, and system integration with existing infrastructure. Installation scope covers physical setup, power connections, network connectivity, and initial system commissioning.

Integration services ensure seamless connectivity with existing systems through standard APIs, data migration support, and custom interface development where required. All integration work follows established security protocols and change management procedures to minimize operational impact.

## Training & Commissioning

Comprehensive training program includes administrator training, end-user instruction, and operational handover procedures. Training covers system operation, basic troubleshooting, security procedures, and maintenance requirements through both classroom and hands-on sessions.

System commissioning includes performance validation, security verification, backup system testing, and final acceptance procedures. All systems undergo full operational testing before handover with documented verification of performance benchmarks and security controls.

## Client Responsibilities

Client provides suitable facility space with appropriate power, cooling, and network infrastructure. Site access, security clearances, and coordination with internal teams are client responsibilities. Client designates technical contacts and provides necessary system documentation for integration planning.

Client maintains existing infrastructure, provides backup facilities during implementation, and ensures staff availability for training sessions. Any specialized regulatory approvals or facility modifications beyond standard installation requirements are client responsibilities.

## Standards & Compliance

All deliverables conform to industry-standard security frameworks, quality management systems, and applicable regulatory requirements. Equipment meets standard environmental and electromagnetic compatibility specifications for commercial deployment environments.
