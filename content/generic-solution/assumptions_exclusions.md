# Assumptions & Exclusions

## Project Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Client provides adequate facility space with appropriate power, cooling, and network infrastructure meeting specified requirements
- Existing network infrastructure supports integration requirements with sufficient bandwidth and security controls
- Client technical staff possess basic system administration capabilities for routine operational tasks

### Operational Assumptions
- Project timelines remain flexible to accommodate reasonable schedule adjustments based on client availability and resource constraints
- Client designates qualified technical contacts for coordination and provides necessary system documentation for integration planning
- Standard business hours availability for installation and testing activities unless alternative arrangements are specifically negotiated

## Scope Exclusions

### Services Not Included
- Custom software development beyond standard configuration and integration activities specified in the technical requirements
- Ongoing operational support beyond the initial warranty period and training deliverables included in the base proposal
- Infrastructure modifications including facility upgrades, power system enhancements, or network backbone improvements

## Client Dependencies

Client maintains responsibility for existing system backups, internal change management approvals, and coordination with third-party vendors not directly related to this project. Client provides necessary security clearances and facility access for installation personnel during agreed timeframes.

Staff availability for training sessions and system handover procedures represents a critical project dependency requiring client resource allocation throughout the implementation timeline.

## Boundary Conditions

Project scope includes only equipment and services explicitly specified in the technical proposal. Any additional requirements, scope modifications, or enhanced functionality requests require separate evaluation and may result in schedule or cost adjustments through formal change control procedures.
