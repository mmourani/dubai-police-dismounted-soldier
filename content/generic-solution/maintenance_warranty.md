# Maintenance, Warranty & SLA

## Maintenance Program

Comprehensive maintenance strategy combines preventive and corrective maintenance approaches to optimize system reliability and performance. Maintenance activities follow manufacturer recommendations with customized schedules based on operational intensity and environmental conditions.

Remote monitoring capabilities enable proactive maintenance scheduling through predictive analytics identifying components approaching service intervals. Maintenance documentation tracks all activities with trend analysis supporting optimization decisions.

## Preventive Maintenance

Scheduled maintenance includes quarterly system health checks, semi-annual component inspections, and annual comprehensive overhauls. Maintenance intervals adjust based on usage patterns and environmental exposure with accelerated schedules for high-intensity deployments.

Preventive procedures cover cleaning, calibration, software updates, and component replacement based on lifecycle recommendations. Maintenance windows coordinate with operational schedules to minimize service disruption.

## Warranty Coverage

Comprehensive warranty provides three-year coverage for hardware defects, software malfunctions, and component failures under normal operating conditions. Coverage includes parts, labor, and technical support with on-site service for critical repairs.

Warranty exclusions cover damage from misuse, environmental conditions exceeding specifications, and modifications not performed by authorized personnel. Extended warranty options provide continued coverage beyond standard terms.

## Service Level Agreements (SLA)

Performance guarantees include 99.5% system availability with maximum downtime of 36 hours per year for scheduled maintenance. Response time commitments provide 4-hour acknowledgment for critical issues and 8-hour response for routine support requests.

Resolution targets vary by severity with critical system failures requiring restoration within 24 hours and non-critical issues resolved within 72 hours of initial response.

## Response & Resolution Times

Support structure provides escalation pathways ensuring appropriate technical expertise for complex issues. Emergency support includes 24/7 availability for critical system failures with expedited parts delivery and on-site technician deployment.

Remote diagnostic capabilities enable immediate assessment and resolution for software-related issues while hardware failures trigger automated parts ordering and technician scheduling.

## Maintenance Resources

Spare parts inventory includes critical components with guaranteed availability within 48 hours of order placement. Specialized tools and test equipment remain available through regional service centers with loaner programs during extended repairs.
