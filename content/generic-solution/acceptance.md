# Factory & Site Acceptance Criteria

## Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)

Pre-delivery testing validates all system components against specified requirements in a controlled environment. FAT procedures include hardware verification, software functionality testing, and integration validation with simulated client environments.

Testing encompasses performance benchmarks, security controls, and interface compatibility verification. All defects identified during FAT receive resolution and retesting before equipment shipment. Comprehensive test documentation provides traceability for all acceptance criteria validation.

## Site Acceptance Testing (SAT)

On-site testing confirms system operation within the actual deployment environment including integration with existing infrastructure and validation of real-world performance characteristics. SAT procedures verify installation quality, configuration accuracy, and operational functionality.

Environmental testing confirms proper operation under site-specific conditions including power quality, network connectivity, and physical security integration. User acceptance testing validates system functionality from operator perspectives with realistic operational scenarios.

## Performance Benchmarks

Quantitative performance criteria include system response times under 2 seconds for standard operations, processing throughput meeting specified capacity requirements, and network latency within acceptable parameters. Availability targets require 99.9% uptime measurement over continuous 30-day periods.

Security validation confirms encryption performance, authentication response times, and access control functionality. Backup and recovery testing demonstrates restoration capabilities within specified recovery time objectives.

## Testing Procedures

Systematic testing follows documented procedures with clear success criteria, failure handling protocols, and retest requirements. Test execution includes automated scripts for reproducible results and manual procedures for user experience validation.

Testing phases progress from individual component verification through integrated system validation and full operational testing. Each phase requires formal sign-off before proceeding to subsequent testing levels.

## Sign-off Process

Formal approval workflows require documented evidence of successful test completion with client representative participation and approval. Sign-off procedures include technical validation by designated personnel and management approval for project progression.

Conditional acceptance addresses minor deficiencies with agreed resolution timelines while maintaining project schedule objectives. Final acceptance requires complete resolution of all identified issues and formal documentation approval.

## Acceptance Documentation

Comprehensive documentation includes test procedures, results summaries, defect tracking, and resolution verification. Certification packages provide compliance evidence and performance validation for ongoing operational reference and audit requirements.
