# Vendor & Supplier Management

## Vendor Selection Criteria

Supplier evaluation process encompasses technical capability, quality management systems, financial stability, and delivery performance history. Qualification criteria include ISO certification, proven track record in similar projects, and demonstrated capacity to meet project requirements.

Due diligence procedures verify vendor credentials, reference customer feedback, and assess supply chain resilience. Selection decisions balance technical merit, cost competitiveness, and strategic partnership potential for long-term collaboration.

## Supplier Management

Vendor relationship management maintains regular communication through scheduled reviews, performance assessments, and collaborative improvement initiatives. Account management ensures alignment between vendor capabilities and project requirements throughout engagement lifecycle.

Contract administration includes milestone tracking, deliverable verification, and payment processing aligned with performance achievements. Escalation procedures address performance issues with corrective action plans and timeline recovery strategies.

## Supply Chain Strategy

Multi-supplier approach reduces dependency risks through diversified sourcing relationships and alternate supply pathways. Strategic partnerships with tier-one suppliers provide preferential treatment and priority capacity allocation during high-demand periods.

Geographic distribution of suppliers supports local sourcing requirements while maintaining global supply chain flexibility. Inventory management balances carrying costs against stockout risks through demand forecasting and buffer stock optimization.

## Performance Monitoring

Vendor scorecards track quality metrics, delivery performance, cost competitiveness, and service responsiveness through quantitative measurement systems. Monthly performance reviews identify trends and improvement opportunities with collaborative action planning.

Performance benchmarking compares vendor results against industry standards and competitive alternatives. Continuous improvement programs incentivize vendor innovation and efficiency gains through partnership recognition and increased business allocation.

## Contract Management

Standardized contract templates ensure consistent terms and conditions across vendor relationships while accommodating project-specific requirements. Service level agreements define performance expectations with clear measurement criteria and penalty structures for non-compliance.

## Risk Mitigation

Supply chain risk assessment identifies vulnerabilities including single-source dependencies, geographic concentration, and financial stability concerns. Contingency planning includes alternate suppliers, buffer inventory, and expedited sourcing procedures for critical components.
