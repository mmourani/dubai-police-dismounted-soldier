# Security Model (Comms, Device, Data)

## Security Architecture

The comprehensive security framework implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple protection layers addressing communications, device, and data security requirements. Security controls integrate throughout the system architecture, providing continuous protection from initial deployment through operational lifecycle.

Risk-based security design addresses current threat landscapes while maintaining flexibility for evolving security requirements. The framework aligns with industry standards including NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 guidelines for systematic security management.

## Communications Security

All network communications utilize TLS 1.3 encryption with certificate-based authentication and perfect forward secrecy. VPN connections protect remote access with multi-factor authentication requirements and session monitoring capabilities.

Network segmentation isolates critical system components with firewall controls and intrusion detection systems monitoring all traffic flows. Secure protocols including HTTPS, SFTP, and encrypted database connections ensure data protection during transmission.

## Device Security

Endpoint protection includes anti-malware systems, device encryption, and automated security updates with centralized management capabilities. Device access controls implement certificate-based authentication with regular credential rotation and revocation procedures.

Physical security measures protect hardware components through secure mounting, tamper detection, and environmental monitoring. Device configuration management ensures consistent security settings across all system components with automated compliance verification.

## Data Protection

Data encryption protects information at rest using AES-256 standards with secure key management and rotation procedures. Database encryption includes field-level protection for sensitive information with granular access controls based on user roles and responsibilities.

Data classification frameworks ensure appropriate protection levels based on information sensitivity. Backup systems maintain encrypted copies with secure offsite storage and verified recovery procedures meeting organizational continuity requirements.

## Authentication & Access Control

Multi-factor authentication combines password, token, and biometric verification methods with adaptive risk assessment capabilities. Role-based access controls implement least-privilege principles with regular access reviews and automated provisioning workflows.

Single sign-on integration supports existing identity management systems while maintaining centralized audit trails and session management. Password policies enforce complexity requirements with secure storage and transmission protocols.

## Security Monitoring & Response

Security information and event management (SIEM) systems provide real-time threat detection with automated response capabilities and escalation procedures. Continuous monitoring includes network traffic analysis, system behavior monitoring, and vulnerability scanning with remediation tracking.

Incident response procedures include containment strategies, forensic analysis capabilities, and recovery protocols. Regular security assessments and penetration testing validate security controls and identify improvement opportunities.
